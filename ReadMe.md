# Machine Learning

**What is this repo?**

This repo is me learning to implement different machine learning algorithms. These models are intended to work, but not intended to be used. While they fit and predict how the official models do, they dont have many 'bells and whistles' that the official implementations would have.

**How can you use this repo?**

Learning - If you are looking to learn how different algorithms treat data, feel free to look at the 'init' and 'predict' functions of each algorithm. They will tell you how a model trains itself to predict data, and how they use these parameters to make predictions.

**Is this a finished product?**

No, I plan on finishing the XGBoost classifier. If I find time I may also visualize the predictions of each model. If you have any good algorithms you think would be a good addition, please send me a message and I'll probably do it eventually.
